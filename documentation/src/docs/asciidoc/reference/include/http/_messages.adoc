[[HTTPMessages]]
=== HTTP messages

The Holon platform provides an implementation-independent representation of the *Hypertext Transfer Protocol* request and response messages, used by other platform modules to deal with HTTP-based operations.

The HTTP request and response message representations are based on the core link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/messaging/Message.html[Message^] interface, which represent a generic _message_ consisting of a map of message *headers* (identified by a textual header name) and a *payload* which represents the content delivered in the message.

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/http/HttpMessage.html[HttpMessage^] API is the base HTTP message representation.

==== Headers

For a HTTP message, the header values are represented as a `List` of Strings, since HTTP supports multiple values for each header. 

The `HttpMessage` API, through the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/http/HttpHeaders.html[HttpHeaders^] interface, provides a set of methods to inspect the HTTP message headers and obtain header values in a more useful and convenient way.

For example, frequently used header values can be obtained using a suitable Java type, if the value is available in the HTTP message headers.

include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleMessage.java[tag=httpheaders,indent=0]
----
<1> Get the value of given header name, if present. If the HTTP header is present more than once then the values are joined together and separated by a `,` character.
<2> Get the value of the HTTP `Date` header, if available, as a Java `Date` instance
<3> Get the value of the HTTP `Location` header, if available, as a Java `URI` instance
<4> Get the value of the HTTP `Content-Length` header, if available, as a Java `Long`
<5> Get the first (most _qualified_) `Locale` using the `Accept-Language` header, if present.
<6> Get a list of `Locale` languages using the `Accept-Language` header, if present. If more than one language is specified in the `Accept-Language` header, returned Locales will be ordered relying on _quality_  parameter.
<7> Get the _basic_ authorization credentials from a `Basic` type HTTP `Authorization` header, if available. The credentials are decoded from Base64 and returned as a username/password array.
<8> Get the _bearer_ authorization token from a `Bearer` type HTTP `Authorization` header, if available. 

[[HttpRequest]]
==== HttpRequest

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/http/HttpRequest.html[HttpRequest^] API represents a HTTP *request* message.

Besides the operations made available from the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/http/HttpMessage.html[HttpMessage^] API, it provides the following informations and operations:

* The HTTP *method* describing the desired action to be performed.
* The fully qualified name of the client host or the last proxy that sent the request.
* The request message _path_.
* The request URI query parameters, if any.
* The request _cookies_, if any.
* The request message body (payload) as an `InputStream`.

The `HttpRequest` message type is bound to a `String` type message payload.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleMessage.java[tag=httprequest,indent=0]
----
<1> Get the HTTP request _method_ as `HttpMethod` enumeration value
<2> Get the path of the HTTP request, relative to the base URI 
<3> Get a request URI parameter value, if available. If the parameter is multi-value, the values are joined together and separated by a `,` character
<4> Get the values of a multi-value request URI parameter, if available
<5> Get a request `Cookie` value, if available
<6> Get the message body as a `String`
<7> Get the message body as an `InputStream`

[[HttpResponse]]
==== HttpResponse

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/http/HttpResponse.html[HttpResponse^] interface represents a HTTP *response* message.

Besides the operations made available from the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/http/HttpMessage.html[HttpMessage^] API, it provides the following informations and operations:

* The HTTP _status code_ of the response, also represented with the convenience link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/http/HttpStatus.html[HttpStatus^] enumeration.
* A _builder_ to create default `HttpResponse` instances.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleMessage.java[tag=httpresponse,indent=0]
----
<1> Get the HTTP response status code
<2> Get the HTTP response status using the `HttpStatus` enumeration

[[ServletHttpMessage]]
==== Servlet API integration

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/http/servlet/ServletHttpRequest.html[ServletHttpRequest^] API represents a `HttpRequest` backed by a `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest` instance, and can be used as an adapter to deal with servlet request messages using the Holon Platform `HttpRequest` API.

The `ServletHttpRequest` API provides additional methods to obtain servlet related message information:

* The request _context_ path.
* The request _URI_.
* The HTTP _session_ id.

To obtain a `HttpRequest` API from a servlet `HttpServletRequest` instance, the `ServletHttpRequest`   `create(HttpServletRequest request)` method can be used.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleMessage.java[tag=servletrequest,indent=0]
----
<1> Create a `HttpRequest` API from a `HttpServletRequest` instance

TIP: This way, a servlet request can be used for example with a Holon `MessageAuthenticator` to perform authentication operations directly using the request message. See the <<MessageAuthenticator>> section for further information.
