=== Java Beans and the `Property` model

The Holon platform offers a wide support to handle standard link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/spec-136004.html[Java Beans^] and seamlessy integrate them with the platform <<Property,Property model>>.

A Java Bean can be seen as a collection of typed _properties_, with _getter_ and _setter_ methods to read and write the property values. From this perspective, we can introduce the following analogies:

* A Bean property can be represented by a <<Property,Property>>.
* The Bean definition (the collection of the declared properties) can be represented by a <<PropertySet,PropertySet>>.
* A Bean instance, which holds the property values, can be represented by a <<PropertyBox,PropertyBox>>.

The Holon platform provides a complete API to manage Java Beans using the *property model*, making available all the essential services to switch from one model to another, i.e. to handle a Bean as a `Property` set and to manage the Bean property values through a `PropertyBox`, both to read the Bean property values and to write them.

==== Bean properties

A Java Bean property is represented by a <<PathProperty>>, where the property *path name* corresponds to the Bean *property name*. 

*Nested* Bean classes are supported, keeping the property hierarchy intact: i.e. the parent property of a `PathProperty` obtained from the bean property of a nested class will be the bean property to which the nested class refers to.

Internally, a Bean property is actually represented by a `PathProperty` extension, which is defined through the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/beans/BeanProperty.html[BeanProperty^] interface. A `BeanProperty` instance holds the references to the Bean property _getter_ and _setter_ methods, besides other property configuration attributes, to ensure consistency for the property value read and write operations.

[[BeanPropertySet]]
==== Bean property set

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/beans/BeanPropertySet.html[BeanPropertySet^] interface represents the collection of the Bean definition properties as a `PropertySet`.

The `BeanPropertySet` is obtained from a Bean class and provides the available Bean properties as `PathProperty` references.

Fully supports *nested* bean classes, allowing to access the nested bean class properties by name using the conventional *dot notation*, for example `parentProperty.nestedProperty`.

The `BeanPropertySet` API extends the default `PropertySet` API and additionally provides operations to:

* Obtain a Bean property *by name* as a `PathProperty`.
* *Read* and *write* single property values to and from an instance of the Java Bean class bound to the set.
* *Read* the property values from a Bean instance and obtain such values as a `PropertyBox`.
* *Write* the property values contained in a `PropertyBox` to a Bean instance.

A `BeanPropertySet` can be simply obtained from a Bean class using the `create(Class beanClass)` method.

<1> Get the `BeanPropertySet` of the `MyBean` class
<2> Get the `PathProperty` which corresponds to the `id` bean property name, obtaining an `Optional` which is empty if the property name is not found within the bean property set  
<3> Get the _required_ `PathProperty` which corresponds to the `id` bean property name: if not found, an exception is thrown
<4> Get the _nested_ property which corresponds to the full path `nested.nestedName`
<5> Read the value of the property with the `id` path name from given bean instance (`1`)
<6> Read all the values of the bean property set from given bean instance, obtaining a `PropertyBox` which contains the read values
<7> Read the value of the `id` property from the `PropertyBox` obtained in previous read operation (`1`)
<8> Write the `test` value to the property with path `nested.nestedName` in given bean instance
<9> Write all the values of given `PropertyBox` to the given bean instance

In addition to the standard `PathProperty` representation, a Bean property can be also obtained as a specific sub type, when type consistency is ensured. The supported sub types are the builtin <<PathPropertySubTypes>> made available by the Holon platform.

Each Bean property can be obtained as a specific `PathProperty` type using the appropriate methods of the `BeanPropertySet` API. When type consistency is not respected, an exception is thrown.

<4> Get the Bean property named `aBooleanTypeBeanPropertyName` as a `BooleanProperty`

[[BeanIntrospector]]
==== BeanIntrospector

A `BeanPropertySet` is built using the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/beans/BeanIntrospector.html[BeanIntrospector^] API. It provides methods to actually obtain a `BeanPropertySet` from a Bean class, introspecting it to resolve the Bean properties and their configuration.

The `BeanIntrospector` interface provides static methods to obtain a `BeanIntrospector` as a <<Context>> resource, if available, or retrieve the default implementation, which is always available.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleBeans.java[tag=introspector,indent=0]
----
<1> Get the current `BeanIntrospector`, i.e. the instance registered as a <<Context>> resource, or the default instance if not available in context
<2> Introspect given bean class and obtain a `BeanPropertySet` which contains all detected bean properties

Furthermore, the `BeanIntrospector` API makes available convenience methods to directly obtain a Bean instance as a `PropertyBox` and vice-versa.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleBeans.java[tag=introspector2,indent=0]
----
<1> Read the given `MyBean` instance as a `PropertyBox`. The `PropertyBox` property set will be the `MyBean` class bean property set
<2> Write a `PropertyBox` into a `MyBean` instance. The `PropertyBox` property values, matched by name, will be written into the corresponding Bean instance properties

The `BeanIntrospector` API is easily *extensible* regarding the introspection strategy, especially for the Bean properties configuration. The main extension points are represented by the `BeanPropertyPostProcessor` and the `BeanPropertySetPostProcessor` interfaces, as described below.

[[BeanPropertyPostProcessor]]
==== BeanPropertyPostProcessor

A link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/beans/BeanPropertyPostProcessor.html[BeanPropertyPostProcessor^] can be used to extend the Bean introspection strategy at Bean properties level, before they will be returned as part of the final `BeanPropertySet`.

A `BeanPropertyPostProcessor` can be used for example to set <<PropertyConfiguration,property configuration>> attributes, manage <<PropertyValidation,property validators>>, configure <<PropertyValueConverter,property value converters>> and so on.

A `BeanPropertyPostProcessor` must be registered in the `BeanIntrospector` and it is called for every detected and valid Bean property at Bean introspection time. The `processBeanProperty` method accepts the current `BeanProperty` builder, which can be used to modify the configuration of the Property that will be part of the final `BeanPropertySet`.

The registration of a `BeanPropertyPostProcessor` can be performed in two ways: 

*1. Registration using the `BeanIntrospector`*: The `addBeanPropertyPostProcessor` method can be used to register a `BeanPropertyPostProcessor`.

*2. Registration using the standard Java service extensions*: `BeanPropertyPostProcessor` registration can be performed also using default Java extension services, providing a _com.holonplatform.core.beans.BeanPropertyPostProcessor_ file under the `META-INF/services` folder containing the fully qualified `BeanPropertyPostProcessor` concrete class names to register.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleBeans.java[tag=postprocessor,indent=0]
----
<1> Register a `BeanPropertyPostProcessor` which adds a `test` property configuration attribute to all the processed properties

TIP: The `jakarta.annotation.Priority` annotation can be used on a `BeanPropertyPostProcessor` implementation class to assign a priority order within the registered processors list, where lower values corresponds to higher priority.

[[BeanPropertySetPostProcessor]]
==== BeanPropertySetPostProcessor

A link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/beans/BeanPropertySetPostProcessor.html[BeanPropertySetPostProcessor^] can be used to extend the Bean introspection strategy at Bean property set level, before the final `BeanPropertySet` is returned.

A `BeanPropertySetPostProcessor` can be used for example to modify the `BeanPropertySet` configuration.

A `BeanPropertySetPostProcessor` must be registered in the `BeanIntrospector` and it is called for each Bean class at Bean introspection time. The `processBeanPropertySet` method accepts the current `BeanPropertySet` builder, which can be used to modify the configuration of Bean property set.

The registration of a `BeanPropertySetPostProcessor` can be performed in two ways: 

*1. Registration using the `BeanIntrospector`*: The `addBeanPropertySetPostProcessor` method can be used to register a `BeanPropertySetPostProcessor`.

*2. Registration using the standard Java service extensions*: `BeanPropertySetPostProcessor` registration can be performed also using default Java extension services, providing a _com.holonplatform.core.beans.BeanPropertySetPostProcessor_ file under the `META-INF/services` folder containing the fully qualified `BeanPropertySetPostProcessor` concrete class names to register.

----
<1> Register a `BeanPropertySetPostProcessor` which adds a `test` property configuration attribute to the Bean property set

TIP: The `jakarta.annotation.Priority` annotation can be used on a `BeanPropertySetPostProcessor` implementation class to assign a priority order within the registered processors list, where lower values corresponds to higher priority.

[[BuiltinBeanPostProcessors]]
==== Builtin Bean post processors

The Holon platform makes available a set of builtin Bean post processors, automatically registered in the default `BeanIntrospector` implementation.

Most of them supports *annotations* on Bean property field which can be used to tune the Bean introspection strategy and to manage Bean properties configuration. 

See below for a list of all the avaiable annotations. All the listed annotations are located in the `com.holonplatform.core.beans` package.

===== @Ignore

The `@Ignore` annotation can be used on Bean property fields to *skip* the Bean property during the introspection process. The ignored property will not be part of the final <<BeanPropertySet>>.

The annotation provides a `includeNested()` attribute which can be used to set whether to ignore any _nested_ Bean property (if the Bean property type is itself a Bean class) or not. Defaults to `true`, which means that if the ignored property is a Bean class type, also the properties of the nested bean class will be ignored.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleBeans.java[tag=ignore,indent=0]
----
<1> Set the `name` property as ignored
<2> The Bean property set will not contain the `name` property

===== @Caption

The `@Caption` annotation can be used on Bean property fields to provide the property *localization* attributes, such as the property _caption_ and the property _caption localization message code_.

See <<PropertyLocalization,the Property localization section>> for further details.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleBeans.java[tag=caption,indent=0]
----
<1> Set the `id` property default caption message to `Code`. The property caption can later be read using the `getMessage()` method of the `Localizable` interface, a super interface of `Property`.
<2> Set the `name` property caption default message and localization message code

===== @Sequence

The `@Sequence` annotation can be used on Bean property fields to *order* the bean properties within the <<BeanPropertySet>>. When used as an `Iterable`, the Bean property set will return the Bean properties ordered according to the _sequence_ value declared through this annotation.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleBeans.java[tag=sequence,indent=0]
----
<1> Set the `id` property sequence number to `10`
<2> Set the `name` property sequence number to `20`: this property will be always returned after the `id` property when the `BeanPropertySet` is used as an `Iterable`

===== @Config

The `@Config` annotation can be used on Bean property fields to add a <<PropertyConfiguration,property configuration>> attribute to the annotated property, specifying the *configuration* key and its value. 

Only `String` type configuration values are supported by this annotation, use your own <<BeanPropertyPostProcessor>> to perform more advanced property configuration setup operations.

The `@Config` annotation is a _repeteable_ annotation, so it can be repeated on a Bean property to provide more than one configuration attribute.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleBeans.java[tag=config,indent=0]
----
<1> Set two property configuration attributes using the `@Config` annotation on the `name` bean property 

===== @Converter

The `@Converter` annotation can be used on Bean property fields to configure a <<PropertyValueConverter, property value converter>> for a bean property.

Besides the `PropertyValueConverter` class to use, the `@Converter` annotation supports the configuration of a *builtin* property value converter through the `builtin()` annotation attribute. The builtin property value converter can be selected among the ones provided by default by the Holon platform.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleBeans.java[tag=converter,indent=0]
----
<1> Set a custom `MyConverter` property value converter for the `id` bean property 
<2> Set a builtin _numeric booelan_ converter for the `value` bean property

===== Validators
 
The Bean property <<PropertyValidation,validation>> can be configured in one of the following ways:

* Using the standard _jakarta.validation.constraints_ bean validation API annotations. The supported annotations are: `@Null`, `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Min`, `@Max`, `@DecimalMin`, `@DecimalMax`, `@Digits`, `@Future`, `@Past`, `@Pattern`. A Bean validation API implementation must be available in classpath.

* Using the additional platform validation annotations: `@NotEmpty` (`CharSequence` not null and not empty), `@NotBlank` (`CharSequence` not null and not empty trimming spaces), `@NotNegative` (`Number` not negative) and `@Email` (`String` is a valid e-mail address).

* Using the _repeteable_ `@Validator` annotation, specifying the custom link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/Validator[Validator^] class to use.

IMPORTANT: For bean validation API and builtin validation annotations, the `message` attribute is used to obtain the *invalid value message* to associate to the validator and, by convention, if the message is included between braces is considered as a localization message code, otherwise as a simple, not localizable, message. The `@ValidationMessage` annotation can be used instead to provide a different, localizable, invalid value message. If such annotation is present, the `message` attribute is ignored.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleBeans.java[tag=validation,indent=0]
----
<1> Set the _mininum_ value for the `id` bean property using the standard _jakarta.validation.constraints_ annotation
<2> Set the _maximum_ value for the `id` bean property using the standard _jakarta.validation.constraints_ annotation and providing the invalid value message localization code
<3> Set the `name` bean property as _not blank_ using the additional platform validation annotation. The `@ValidationMessage` annotation is used to specify the invalid value default message and localization message code
<4> Set two custom `Validator` implementations for the `value` bean property using the `@Validator` repeteable annotation

[[BeanDataPath]]
===== @DataPath

The `@DataPath` annotation can be used on Bean class and on Bean property fields to declare a *data path mapping* as Bean property or property set configuration attributes, using the default `PATH` configuration property of the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/DataMappable[DataMappable^] interface.

The _data path_ mapping can be used to declare the data model attribute *path* when it is not the same as the Bean class name or Bean property name, and the Bean property set is used for persistence related operations.

The data path mapping must be explicitly supported by the data model handler API which will be used, that could be for example a <<Datastore>>.

See the specific Datastore implementation documentation to check the data path mapping support and the actual meaning it assumes.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleBeans.java[tag=datapath,indent=0]
----
<1> Set the data path mapping to `code` for the `id` bean property 
<2> Set the Bean class data path mapping to `myPath`

==== BeanIntrospector cache

The default `BeanIntrospector` implementation uses an internal cache of processed bean class and property sets, to boost introspecton operations and obtain better performaces.

If memory consuption issues are detected, the internal cache can be disabled setting the _holon.beans.introspector-cache-enabled_ configuration property to `false`. To set the configuration property, either a `System` property or a default `holon.properties` file can be used.
